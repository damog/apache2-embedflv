NAME
    Apache2::EmbedFLV - Embed FLV videos into a templated web interface
    using Flowplayer.

SYNOPSIS
    On your Apache configuration file:

     <Files ~ "\.flv$">
       SetHandler modperl
       PerlResponseHandler Apache2::EmbedFLV
     </Files>

    If you want to restrict only a certain directory to serve FLVs using
    "Apache2::EmbedFLV", you can wrap the "Files" declaration on a
    "Directory" block. For more information, take a look at excellent
    Apache2's documentation.

    By default, you have to have "/flowplayer.swf" and
    "/flowplayer.controls.swf" available on your webserver. Both SWFs are
    provided on the GPL distribution of Flowplayer. You can "alias" them
    with something like:

     Alias /flowplayer.swf /home/web/flowplayer-3.0.3.swf
     Alias /flowplayer.controls.swf /home/web/flowplayer.controls.swf

    That's it. Just go to any FLV video within your web server. With that
    setup, "Apache2::EmbedFLV" will use a default template.

TEMPLATING
    Take a look at the default template located at example/template.tt. That
    is not the real file used by this module but it's a verbatim copy. The
    file is placed there just as an example so you can make your own
    template without too much internal poking.

    Once you have your own template, just "PerlSetVar" it to the handler:

     <Files ~ "\.flv$">
       SetHandler modperl
       PerlSetVar template /path/to/my/template.tt
       PerlResponseHandler Apache2::EmbedFLV
     </Files>

    In order to specify a different path than "/flowplayer.swf" for
    Flowplayer, just "PerlSetVar flowplayer" (remember to accompany the
    controls SWF):

     <Files ~ "\.flv$">
       SetHandler modperl
       PerlSetVar template /path/to/my/template.tt
       # you would have to have http://yourserver.com/somewhere/flowplayer.swf:
       PerlSetVar flowplayer /somewhere/flowplayer.swf
       # or...
       PerlSetVar flowplayer http://my.other.server/rocks/flowplayer.swf
       PerlResponseHandler Apache2::EmbedFLV
    </Files>

    I believe it's pretty obvious that the templating system used and
    required is Template::Toolkit. Wherever you want to embed the video
    within, just call: "[% video %]".

DESCRIPTION
    "Apache2::EmbledFLV" has been already described on the previous section
    :-)

    However...

    "Apache2::EmbedFLV" enables Apache to show FLV videos using Flowplayer.
    This will ease any deployment of FLV video galleries you'd need to do
    since you could just put the FLVs on an Apache accessible location, and
    they will be presented on a proper way to your final user.
