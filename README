NAME
    Apache2::EmbedFLV - Embed FLV videos into a templated web interface
    using Flowplayer

SYNOPSIS
    On your Apache configuration file:

     <Files ~ "\.flv$">
       SetHandler modperl
             PerlResponseHandler Apache2::EmbedFLV
     </Files>

    This is needed in order to have Flowplayer work out of the box:

     <Location /flowplayer.swf>
       SetHandler modperl
             PerlResponseHandler Apache2::EmbedFLV::FlowPlayer
     </Location>
     <Location /flowplayer.controls.swf>
       SetHandler modperl
             PerlResponseHandler Apache2::EmbedFLV::FlowPlayer::Controls
     </Location>

    That's it. Just go to any FLV video within your web server.

DESCRIPTION
    "Apache2::EmbedFLV" enables Apache to show FLV videos using Flowplayer
    and a (yet-to-be) customizable template. This will ease any deployment
    of FLV video galleries you'd need to do since you could just put the
    FLVs on an Apache accessible location, and they will be presented on a
    proper way to your final user.

SEE IT IN ACTION
    You can see it in action here:

BEHIND THE SCENES
    "Apache2::EmbedFLV" is a hack. The most prominent hack within the
    distribution is the embedded Flowplayer. You don't need to separately
    download and install it as it is already served using
    "Apache2::EmbedFLV::FlowPlayer", with an up-to-date base64 encoded
    string. This is possible due to: a) ease installation and deployment
    using standard CPAN installation methods, and b) Flowplayer being a nice
    GPL product.

CUSTOMIZATION
    As of 0.1 release, customization of the template is not possible, but it
    shouldn't take that long before this is possible. If you are brave
    though, you can edit lib/Apache/EmbedFLV/Template.pm directly.
