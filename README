NAME
    Apache2::EmbedFLV - Embed FLV videos into a templated web interface
    using Flowplayer.

SYNOPSIS
    On your Apache configuration file:

     <Files ~ "\.flv$">
       SetHandler modperl
       PerlResponseHandler Apache2::EmbedFLV
     </Files>

    If you want to restrict only a certain directory to serve FLVs using
    "Apache2::EmbedFLV", you can wrap the "Files" declaration on a
    "Directory" block. For more information, take a look at excellent
    Apache2's documentation.

    Flowplayer is shipped with this module. This is done to ease deployment.
    You only have to add this to the httpd config:

     <Location /flowplayer.swf>
       SetHandler modperl
       PerlResponseHandler Apache2::EmbedFLV::FlowPlayer
     </Location>
     <Location /flowplayer.controls.swf>
       SetHandler modperl
       PerlResponseHandler Apache2::EmbedFLV::FlowPlayer::Controls
     </Location>

    That's it. Just go to any FLV video within your web server. With that
    setup, "Apache2::EmbedFLV" will use a default template.

ADVANCED POKING
    Take a look at the default template located at example/template.tt. That
    is not the real file used by this module but it's a verbatim copy. The
    file is placed there just as an example so you can make your own
    template without too much internal poking.

    Once you have your own template, just "PerlSetVar" it to the handler:

     <Files "\.flv$">
       SetHandler modperl
       PerlSetVar template /path/to/my/template.tt
       PerlResponseHandler Apache2::EmbedFLV
     </Files>

    Flowplayer is shipped with this distribution. See FLOWPLAYER VERSION for
    versioning details. Within the module, Flowplayer is base64-encoded in
    "Apache2::EmbedFLV::FlowPlayer" and in
    "Apache2::EmbedFLV::FlowPlayer::Controls". This allows great ease of
    deployment and installation on just minimal overhead increase. There
    would be a number of reasons why you wouldn't want this, so this module
    allows you to override that default behaviour. Just "PerlSetVar
    flowplayer":

     <Files "\.flv$">
       SetHandler modperl
       PerlSetVar template /path/to/my/template.tt
       # you would have to have http://yourserver.com/somewhere/flowplayer.swf:
       PerlSetVar flowplayer /somewhere/flowplayer.swf
       # or...
       PerlSetVar flowplayer http://my.other.server/rocks/flowplayer.swf
       PerlResponseHandler Apache2::EmbedFLV
    </Files>

    I believe it's pretty obvious that the templating system used and
    required is Template::Toolkit. Wherever you want to embed the video
    within, just call: "[% video %]".

DESCRIPTION
    "Apache2::EmbledFLV" has been already described on the previous section
    :-)

    However...

    "Apache2::EmbedFLV" enables Apache to show FLV videos using Flowplayer.
    This will ease any deployment of FLV video galleries you'd need to do
    since you could just put the FLVs on an Apache accessible location, and
    they will be presented on a proper way to your final user.

BEHIND THE SCENES
    "Apache2::EmbedFLV" is a hack. The most prominent hack within the
    distribution is the embedded Flowplayer as already explained above. You
    don't need to separately download and install it as it is already served
    using "Apache2::EmbedFLV::FlowPlayer", with an up-to-date base64 encoded
    string. This is possible due to: a) ease installation and deployment
    using standard CPAN installation methods, and b) Flowplayer being a nice
    GPL product.

FLOWPLAYER VERSION
    Flowplayer 3.0.3 is the one shipped with "Apache2::EmbedFLV" 0.1. Refer
    to <http://flowplayer.org> for details.
